### Decentralized Web as Public Sphere

[paper](/pdf/Decentralized%20Web%20as%20a%20Public%20Sphere.pdf)

##### - Your taste, your deepest fear and your dream are, in a sense, shaped by the allocation of your attention, which are disproportionately allocated to the commercial advertisement, where capital intentionally directs. This can be a silent penetration process, as depicted in the The Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord, where the consumer culture and commodity fetishism would only affect the individual thinking and decision-making in a subconscious way.

### Protocolizing the Governance of Public Goods: Using Social Media as an Example

[paper](/pdf/Protocolizing%20the%20Governance%20of%20Public%20Goods.pdf)

##### - By applying Elinor Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework to common-pool resource problems (Ostrom, 2005), this study aims to explore the possibilities and limitations of protocolization in addressing the governance challenges of social media platforms. In doing so, the paper delves into the paradox of programmability and irreproducibility, examining the potential risks of systematizing and institutionalizing bias (Crawford, 2016), while considering alternative approaches that reimagine the relationship between technology and democracy (Winner, 1986).

Considering the current global economic recession and democracy deconstruction, Greens should be prepared to forgo some universal basic values and adopt more realistic foreign policies, and advocate for strengthening national power, with the emphasis on its representativeness of future and hope.
