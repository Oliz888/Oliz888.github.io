### Quantifying the Complex Relationship between Lyrics, Chord Progression, and Emotion Stimulation Examine the Song Features 

##### - Utilizes Bag of Words and Word2Vec methods, combined with KNN/hierarchical clustering, to identify songs with similar lyrics. Incorporates LDA and sentiment analysis for deeper lyrical understanding. Explores relationships between numerical (tempo, chord progression, key) and textual features using supervised machine learning.
##### - Trianing machine to understand the connection between elements in music, improving recommendation accuracy using machine leanring techniques and textual features

### Decentralized Web as Public Sphere

[paper](/pdf/Decentralized%20Web%20as%20a%20Public%20Sphere.pdf)

##### - Your taste, your deepest fear and your dream are, in a sense, shaped by the allocation of your attention, which are disproportionately allocated to the commercial advertisement, where capital intentionally directs. This can be a silent penetration process, as depicted in the The Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord, where the consumer culture and commodity fetishism would only affect the individual thinking and decision-making in a subconscious way.

### Protocolizing the Governance of Public Goods: Using Social Media as an Example

[paper](/pdf/Protocolizing%20the%20Governance%20of%20Public%20Goods.pdf)

##### - By applying Elinor Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework to common-pool resource problems (Ostrom, 2005), this study aims to explore the possibilities and limitations of protocolization in addressing the governance challenges of social media platforms. In doing so, the paper delves into the paradox of programmability and irreproducibility, examining the potential risks of systematizing and institutionalizing bias (Crawford, 2016), while considering alternative approaches that reimagine the relationship between technology and democracy (Winner, 1986).
